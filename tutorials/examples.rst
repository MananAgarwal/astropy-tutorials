Examples
========

Examples are stand-alone code snippets that live in the astropy documentation that demonstrate a specific functionality within a package.
Examples will not have conceptual background/context or exhaustive explanation of the functionality being demonstrated.

    Examples should have less explanation, it's ok if they prompt questions which can then be answered by scrolling up and down into the documentation.

See the `Astropy Examples <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/generated/examples/index.html>`_ for a structured view of the examples within the Astropy project.
